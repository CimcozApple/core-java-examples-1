# OOPS , STRING, ENUM, ARRAYS, CUSTOM TYPES, CODING

## CODING (Write with Junit)
* Given a character array. Reverse it using custom logic.
* Given a integer sorted array. Search an element in the array. If element not found return -1 and if found then return index of the element.
* Given below 2 sorted arrays. Transform them.
```java
input:
int[] arr1 = {2, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18}
int[] arr2 = {13, 17, 21}
output:
arr1 = {2, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16}
arr2 = {17, 18, 21}
```
* Given a sorted matrix of size 3 * 3. Print the position of an element. If not found return -1.
```java
{ 
  {1, 5, 7},
  {8, 13, 15},
  {17, 19, 21}
}
```
* Without using recursion print the first 10 numbers of fibonaci series.
* Implment selection sort.
* Given an integer unsorted array. sort it without using any sorting logic. But you are allowed to swap any element with first element of the array.
* Given an integer almost sorted array which can be sorted exactly with one swap (no bubble sort). 
```java
int[] arr1 = {2, 4, 5, 9, 13, 11, 12, 10, 14, 17}.
```
